# Celestron Unified (6.1.7350, Feb 2020) Telescope & Focuser

driver for all computerized Celestron telescopes, now including the new Celestron Focuser. NOTE: Focuser moves are prevented if the focuser is not calibrated. Calibrate the Focuser before anything else!	Also this driver does its best to compensate for the extra time needed for final approach in slews but which is not reported via the Celestron controller. See the help file and release notes(!), installed as part of the driver, for a full description.
