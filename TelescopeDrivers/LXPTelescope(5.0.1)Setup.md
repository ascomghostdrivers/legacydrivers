Installs a driver that uses a small subset of the LX-200 protocol. Features are limited, and end-of-slew detection may be unreliable (requires adjustment of encoder resolution). Use this driver with mounts that purport to use the LX-200 protocol. Be prepared for limitations and problems. Simple applications (such as planetarium slewing) are more likely to work than demanding automation applications.
