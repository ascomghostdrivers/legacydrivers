# ASCOM Legacy Drivers
This repository is provided to enable the ASCOM community to download drivers that are no longer supported by their original authors.
These drivers may, or may not, work without problems. 

If you would like to take on maintenance of one of these drivers, please [Raise an Issue](https://github.com/ascomghostdrivers/legacydrivers/issues) on this repository or post on the [ASCOM Developer Forum](https://ascomtalk.groups.io/g/Developer/topics) and we will remove the driver from this repository and link to your new support repository.
